<H1> LibrarySystem2.0.1 </H1>
This version of our library system adds to our initial version 1 of our library system that can be found here: https://github.com/310g17/librarySystem</br>
We decided to not branch and to create a new repository as this version is far different than the initial as a complete system overhaul was required. Methods from the first version may remain, however, the code will differ as we've abandoned the initial .csv approach to our system. <br/>
Our initial goal still remains the same. Our teamâ€™s project is focused on the creation of a library system that primarily focuses on the borrowing feature of a library. The library system will be created as an app as we believe the mobility of a mobile device is handy for librarians that want to check and see book. Furthermore, our website is centred around 5 main features. Our primary feature will be the ability to check in and check out, this system will function around our book database that tracks our stock of books. Aside from borrowing and returning books, we also want to implement a simple filtering tool. There is another feature we decided to implement, which is the idea of an individual account. Users and administrators will have their own accounts, each with different access levels. Administrators have access to the addition and removal of borrowable books in the database of books. To support the library in terms of its security, we have decided to implement a tracking system for books. If a person has borrowed 2 books or an overdue book (books borrowed for over 2 weeks) they are unable to borrow more. </br>
The core functionalities of our system is still the same however, due to the previous systems limitations of using a .csv file to store our data we will transition into SQL for better code readability and overall performance. Furthermore, by using SQL we believe it will be easier to solve the issue of data storage. <br/>
